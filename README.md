# Currency Converter - C# .NET 8 - Dijkstra's algorithm 

Welcome to the Currency Converter project! This application, built with C# and .NET 8, provides efficient and accurate currency conversion. It leverages Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path for conversions when a direct exchange rate is not available. The system ensures high performance and thread safety using concurrent data structures and memory caching.


## Features

- **Efficient Currency Conversion:** Quickly convert amounts between different currencies using both direct and indirect exchange rates.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** Implemented to find the shortest path for conversions that do not have a direct exchange rate, ensuring accurate and efficient results.
- **Thread-Safe Operations:** Utilizes concurrent data structures and locking mechanisms to ensure thread safety and data integrity.
- **Memory Caching:** Uses in-memory caching to store conversion results and improve performance.
- **Configuration Management:** Easily update and clear exchange rate configurations.
